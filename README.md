This presentation will be about the React library, of course, it is impossible to talk about all the charms and function of this library in 10 minutes, but I will try to at least tell you how to start working with React.

In addition, React has platforms such as:
- Instagram
- Netflix
- WhatsApp
And many others.

React â€“ declarative.
It is easy enough to create various user interfaces on it and React will update them in a timely manner when data changes.
Declarative representations allow you to make the code more understandable and readable.

React is based on a component approach. React divides our application into components.

Congratulations! You have taken the first steps in the development of React applications, mastered the basics that allow you to start creating your own projects and continue to study productively.
